# Heroes of Pymoli

This is an analysis of data regarding the purchase of items in the video game Heroes of Pymoli. The analysis reads a csv to calculate the total number of players, their activity among different demographic groups (gender/age), the number of unique items, the average price of an item, the total number of purchases made, the most popular items, the most profitable items, and the total amount of revenue generated. The resulting dataframes appear as follows:

The all encompassing totals and averages are:
- Total players: 576
- Number of Unique Items: 179
- Average Price: 3.05
- Number of Purchases: 780
- Total Revenue: 2379.77

Some significant observations I noticed in the data are that:
- Males account for an overwhealming majority of the revenue gathered by selling items
- People who are either gender non-binary or chose not to disclose their gender spend the most on any given item on average
- Nearly half of all players are between the ages of 20 and 24 (inclusive)
