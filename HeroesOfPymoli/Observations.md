# pandas-challenge Observations

Three significant observations I noticed in the data are:
1) Males account for an overwhealming majority of the revenue gathered by selling items
2) People who are either gender non-binary or chose not to disclose their gender spend the most on any given item on average
3) Nearly half of all players are between the ages of 20 and 24 (inclusive)
