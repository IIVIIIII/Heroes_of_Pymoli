# Observations

Some significant observations I noticed in the data are that:
- Males account for an overwhealming majority of the revenue gathered by selling items
- People who are either gender non-binary or chose not to disclose their gender spend the most on any given item on average
- Nearly half of all players are between the ages of 20 and 24 (inclusive)
